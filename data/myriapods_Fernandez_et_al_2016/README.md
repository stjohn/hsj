# HSJ: Myriapods dataset #

 A character matrix from a large study of living and fossil myriapods [Fernandez et al 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syw041). The original matrix was coded using a reductive coding strategy [sensu Strong and Lipscomb 1999](https://doi.org/10.1006/clad.1999.0114). We modified it slightly so that the characters were coded hierarchically as expected by the HSJ approach [Appendix 3; Hopkins and St. John 2018](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2018.1784). For this study, we also removed tertiary characters. The dataset has 47 taxa and 200 characters, 129 of which are primary characters.
