# HSJ: Data #

The datasets:

+ [brachiopods_Cusack_et_al_1999](Brachiopods):  A moderately-sized study of fossil brachiopods.  Originally coded with non-additive binary coding, it has been recoded using redundant/hierarhical coding for this study.

+ [myriapods_Fernandez_et_al_2016](Myriapods):  A character matrix from a large study of living and fossil myriapods (Fernandez et al 2016), modified slightly to use hierarchical coding and removing tertiary characters.

+ [synthetic_8_leaves](Synthetic):  Two synthetic datasets on 8 leaves with 10 primary characters of 13 and 20 characters overall.  The tenth primary character indicates the presence or absence of the secondary traits.
