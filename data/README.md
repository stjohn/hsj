# HSJ: Data #

The datasets consist of a character matrix and an associated file of character types indicating which characters are primary, which are secondary, and for the secondary characters which character is their controlling primary.

+ [Brachiopods](brachiopods_Cusack_et_al_1999/README.md):  A moderately-sized study of fossil brachiopods \([Cusack et al 1999](https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-4983.00098)\).  Originally coded with non-additive binary coding, it has been recoded using redundant/hierarhical coding for this study.

+ [Myriapods](myriapods_Fernandez_et_al_2016/README.md):  A character matrix from a large study of living and fossil myriapods \([Fernandez et al 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syw041)\), modified slightly to use hierarchical coding and removing tertiary characters.

+ [Synthetic](synthetic_8_leaves/README.md):  Two synthetic datasets on 8 leaves with 10 primary characters of 13 and 20 characters overall.  The tenth primary character indicates the presence or absence of the secondary traits.
