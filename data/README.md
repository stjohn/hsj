# HSJ: Data #

The datasets:

+ [Brachiopods](data/brachiopods_Cusack_et_al_1999/README.md):  A moderately-sized study of fossil brachiopods (Cusack et al 1999).  Originally coded with non-additive binary coding, it has been recoded using redundant/hierarhical coding for this study.

+ [Myriapods](data/myriapods_Fernandez_et_al_2016/README.md):  A character matrix from a large study of living and fossil myriapods (Fernandez et al 2016), modified slightly to use hierarchical coding and removing tertiary characters.

+ (Synthetic)[data/synthetic_8_leaves/README.md]:

+ [Synthetic](data/synthetic_8_leaves/README.md):  Two synthetic datasets on 8 leaves with 10 primary characters of 13 and 20 characters overall.  The tenth primary character indicates the presence or absence of the secondary traits.
