# HSJ #

Includes code, examples and some data files for computing the HSJ disparity metric and scoring phylogenetic trees under the optimality criteria for phylogenetic trees.

## What's here: ##

The repo is organized into 3 folders, corresponding to code, illustrative examples, and the data files used in Hopkins & St. John, in prep.
