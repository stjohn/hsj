# HSJ:  Code #

This directory contains the following R scripts:

+ `dissimilarity_functions.R`:  functions from [Hopkins and St. John 2018](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2018.1784) that compute the dissimilarity between two taxa, where the contribution of secondary characters (if present) can be scaled by a parameter alpha.  These functions have been modified from those published in [Hopkins and St. John 2018](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2018.1784) to accommodate changes in the hierarchical structure of lists expected by the Claddis R package (informally a "Claddis object") [Lloyd 2016](https://doi.org/10.1111/bij.12746).
+ `hsjScorer.R`:
